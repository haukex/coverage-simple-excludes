Simple ``coverage`` Exclusions
==============================

This is a simple plugin for [Coverage.py](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/).
When you enable it, for example in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
plugins = ["coverage_simple_excludes"]
```

Then, in addition to the default `# pragma: no cover`, you get several more comments in the
format `# cover-...` that you can use to specify that lines or blocks of code should be excluded from coverage:

- `# cover-req-ltX.Y` and `# cover-req-geX.Y`, where:
  - `X` and `Y` are the major and minor Python version, respectively
  - `lt` means "a Python version lower than `X.Y` is required for this line or block of code
    to be executed and included in the coverage check"
  - `ge` means "a Python version equal to or higher than `X.Y` is required"
- `# cover-not-Z` and `# cover-only-Z`, where:
  - `not` means "this code is not executed on this os/platform/implementation"
  - `only` means "this code is only executed on this os/platform/implementation"
  - `Z` may be any of the following values:
    - [`os.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name):
      "posix", "nt", "java"
    - [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform):
      "aix", "emscripten", "linux", "wasi", "win32", "cygwin", "darwin"
    - [`sys.implementation.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.implementation):
      "cpython", "ironpython", "jython", "pypy"

Note the comments are case-sensitive. Any amount of whitespace is allowed between
the `#` and `cover`, including no space.

Examples
--------

```python
if sys.platform != 'win32':  # cover-not-win32
    print("This code is only executed on non-win32 systems")
else:  # cover-only-win32
    print("This code is only executed on win32 systems")

if sys.hexversion < 0x03_0C:  # cover-req-lt3.12
    print("This code is only executed on a version of Python before 3.12")
else:  # cover-req-ge3.12
    print("This code is only executed on Python 3.12 or later")
```
